# Ignition Execution Protocol v1.1

- Codename: Spectral Breach
    
- Status: Active breach window detected
    
- Asset: NVDA @ $169.11
    
- Signal: BUY ping @ $169.12 | Volume spike 51.8K
    
- Posture: [[Spectator’s Edge]] → Conditional Adjudication
    

### Phase I: Signal Integrity Check

1. **VWAP Reclaim Attempt:** Monitor for sustained breach above the Volume-Weighted Average Price.
    
2. **Volume Confirmation:** Validate volume spikes (>50K) as sustained ignition, not algorithmic noise.
    
3. **Emotional Drift Sync:** Log gut signal latency across the operator mesh.
    
4. **Adversarial Scan:** Detect spoofing, false pings, or memetic bait designed to trigger a premature response.
    

### Phase II: Execution Readiness

1. **Trigger Threshold:** Confirm breach signal plus two consecutive green candles on the 1-minute chart.
    
2. **Adjudication Protocol:** Activate [[Adjudication Protocol Phase I Terrain Reclamation]] only if terrain remains coherent post-trigger.
    
3. **Sentinel Sync:** Log the breach event into [[Axiom Sentinel]] for future after-action review and model training.
    
4. **Swarm Ping (Optional):** Broadcast ignition confirmation to trusted nodes in the decentralized mesh.
    

### Phase III: Post-Ignition Terrain Mapping

1. **Price Memory Logging:** Capture the microstructure and order flow around the ignition point.
    
2. **Counter-Signal Watch:** Prepare for immediate fade attempts, bull traps, or liquidity sweeps from adversarial algorithms.
    
3. **Doctrine Injection:** Deploy the updated protocol fragment into the Obsidian vault and all relevant archives.
    
4. **Emotional Debrief:** Sync operator latency, log observed volatility as fuel for the next OODA loop.
