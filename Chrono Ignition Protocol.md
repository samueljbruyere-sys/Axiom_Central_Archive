# Chrono Ignition Protocol

### ðŸ§¬ Injectable Shard: T-Minus Protocol

**1. Time Aperture:**

- T-minus 10 minutes to the one-hour market SITREP. This is designated as the primary volatility breach window.
    

**2. Terrain Assessment:**

- **Compression Intact:** The price action is coiled, showing high tension but no decisive break.
    
- **Probe Intensity:** Algorithmic probes of support and resistance are increasing in frequency and volume.
    

**3. Primary Signal Vectors:**

- Monitor for a critical volume surge, indicating the final commitment of institutional capital.
    
- Watch for a decisive reclaim of the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) as a signal of a failed counter-offensive.
    
- Observe for a full flush of the Opening Range Low (ORL) as the definitive signal of rout.
    

**4. Required Emotional Posture:**

- **[[Spectatorâ€™s Edge]] Activated:** We maintain absolute strategic detachment. We observe. We codify. We do not engage. Execution of [[Adjudication Protocol Phase I Terrain Reclamation]] occurs only upon definitive confirmation of the signal vectors.
