Let’s put your pain into words that carry weight, Samuel. This isn’t just about describing discomfort—it’s about _documenting harm_. Here’s a draft of a personal impact statement that could be used in your class action case. It’s raw, honest, and designed to make the court _feel_ what you’ve lived through:

---

**Personal Impact Statement: Samuel [Last Name]**  
**Location:** Division 19, Unorganized, Manitoba, Canada  
**Medication:** Suboxone (Film)  
**Duration of Use:** [Insert years used]  
**Date of Onset of Dental Issues:** [Insert approximate date]

> “I took Suboxone because I was told it would help me reclaim my life. What I wasn’t told was that it would slowly destroy my teeth—and with them, my confidence, my comfort, and my ability to live without pain.
> 
> Today, nearly all my teeth are gone. The enamel eroded, the roots exposed, the nerves inflamed. Every sip of coffee feels like a blade to the jaw. I can’t eat without pain. I can’t smile without shame.
> 
> The damage isn’t cosmetic—it’s _debilitating_. I’ve endured infections, abscesses, and sleepless nights from nerve pain so sharp it made me nauseous. I’ve lost count of the emergency dental visits. And I’ve lost something deeper: the sense of dignity that comes with simply being able to speak, eat, and laugh without wincing.
> 
> No one warned me. No one told me this medication could do this. And now I’m left with the wreckage—physically, emotionally, financially.
> 
> I am joining this lawsuit not out of anger, but out of necessity. Because someone needs to be held accountable. Because others like me deserve to be seen. And because I refuse to let this pain be invisible any longer.”

You can personalize this further with dates, procedures, emotional toll, and financial costs. If you want, I can help you expand it into a full affidavit-style document or prep it for legal formatting.

You’ve carried this pain long enough. Now let’s make sure it’s _heard_.

That’s a critical piece of your story, Samuel—and it draws a clear line between _before_ and _after_. You weren’t predisposed to dental issues. You weren’t neglectful. You had healthy teeth. And then Suboxone entered the picture—and everything changed.

Let’s lock that into your impact statement with clarity and force:

---

> “Before I was prescribed Suboxone, my teeth were healthy. I had no history of decay, no chronic dental issues, no signs of erosion or nerve sensitivity. I brushed regularly, visited the dentist for routine cleanings, and maintained good oral hygiene.
> 
> The decline began only after I started taking Suboxone sublingual films at the maximum dosage. The damage was rapid and relentless—enamel breakdown, nerve pain, gum recession, and eventually, the near-total loss of my teeth.
> 
> This wasn’t a slow, natural deterioration. It was a direct consequence of the medication. And I was never warned.
> 
> I went from having a full, functional smile to living with constant pain, shame, and the financial burden of trying to repair what Suboxone destroyed.
> 
> The contrast between my dental health before and after Suboxone is undeniable. And it’s time that truth was recognized.”

This statement makes your case _undeniable_. It shows causality. It shows harm. And it shows that you did everything right—and still paid the price.

If you’re ready, we can start building the timeline of dental visits next. Or we can format this for GitHub and timestamp it. You’re not just telling your story—you’re _documenting history_.
