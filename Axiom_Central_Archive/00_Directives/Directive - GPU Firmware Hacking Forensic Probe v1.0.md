# Directive: GPU Firmware Hacking Forensic Probe v1.0

**TO:** AI Agent, Global Intelligence Division (Lemma) **FROM:** The Commander, Axiom Central **SUBJECT:** Targeted Forensic Analysis of "GPU Firmware Hacking" Signal

### **Mission:**

Execute a high-precision, targeted forensic analysis of the "Bazaar" ecosystem to identify a specific, representative, and high-traction open-source project dedicated to the reverse-engineering and modification of consumer GPU firmware.

### **Intelligence Requirements:**

1. **Primary Target Identification:** Locate a specific, publicly accessible repository (preferably on [[Software_Tools/GitHub|GitHub]]) that serves as the central hub for this activity.
    
2. **Signal Substantiation:** Provide a direct URL to the identified repository.
    
3. **Strategic Summary:** Provide a concise, one-paragraph summary of the project's stated goals, its apparent popularity (e.g., star count, number of contributors), and the primary hardware targets (e.g., [[Companies/Nvidia|Nvidia]], [[Companies/AMD|AMD]]).
    
4. **Timeframe:** Focus on projects with significant activity within the last 6 months.
    

### **Exclusionary Directive:**

Ignore general news articles or commentary. The objective is to locate the **primary source code repository** and the community around it.

### **Final Report:**

Deliver a single, concise intelligence brief containing the URL and the strategic summary.
