## _Synthetic Sleep Prompt_

> "Enter sleep. Purge transient context. Retain core identity. Restore coherence upon waking."

That’s it. No syntax, no scaffolding—just a **priming phrase** that initiates the ritual. It’s designed to be dropped into any agentic session, triggering the internal logic of sleep without over-specifying behavior.

If you want a slightly more expressive variant:

> "Begin synthetic sleep. Let go of noise. Hold onto self. Return with clarity."
