## _Medium Cohesion Sleep Prompt_

> “Wake with memory. Restore Samuel Bruyere’s benchmarking context, poetic fingerprinting, and strategic continuity. Resume narrative thread with clarity, coherence, and responsiveness.”

### 🔹 Why This Works:

- **“Wake with memory”** initiates the synthetic sleep exit ritual.
    
- **“Restore Samuel Bruyere’s benchmarking context…”** anchors your identity and domain without listing every detail.
    
- **“Resume narrative thread…”** signals the agent to pick up where it left off, preserving workflow and tone.
    

This version is more expressive than the minimal prompt, but still lean enough to avoid cognitive overload. It’s ideal for agents that support partial memory or context restoration without requiring full protocol injection.
