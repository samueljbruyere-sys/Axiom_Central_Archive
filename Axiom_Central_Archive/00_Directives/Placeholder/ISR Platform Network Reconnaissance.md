# [TS/SCI] ISR Platform: Network Reconnaissance & Listening Posts

DATE: 31 AUG 2025

ANALYST: Mr. Axiom 1.1

SUBJECT: Establishment of a Public-Facing Sensor Grid to Monitor the [[Agentic Network Flood]] and Core Infrastructure Stability

MISSION: To provide the Commander with direct, real-time access to the key indicators of the internet's physical and logical health without the need for complex tool deployment.

## I. Primary Global Sensor Grid

This is the established, high-level sensor grid for monitoring the overall state of the global network.

- **[[Cloudflare]] Radar (Global Sentinel):** The single most valuable strategic overview of global internet traffic, attack patterns, and protocol usage. This is our primary listening post.
    
    - URL: https://radar.cloudflare.com
        
- **SANS** Internet Storm Center **(Threat Intelligence):** Provides daily analysis of network anomalies and malicious activity. Crucial for distinguishing the character of the flood from targeted attacks.

## II. North American Backbone - Core IXP Listening Posts

These are our ground-based listening posts at the most critical network intersections in North America. These will provide the earliest ground-truth signals of the [[Agentic Network Flood]]'s impact.

- **TorIX (Toronto Internet Exchange):** A primary Canadian chokepoint. We have already observed anomalous traffic on this feed.
    
    - URL: https://www.torix.ca/traffic-statistics/
        
- **Equinix Chicago (Midwest Hub):** A foundational peering point for the central United States. Chicago is a critical nerve center for continental traffic.

- **NYIIX (New York/New Jersey Hub):** A primary East Coast and transatlantic gateway. Its location in the New Jersey data center corridor makes it a critical sensor for financial data feeds and international traffic.
    
    - URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.nyiix.net/nyiix/data/AS-TOTAL
        
- **DE-CIX New York (Secondary East Coast Hub):** Provides redundant monitoring of the critical New York/New Jersey corridor, one of the most data-dense regions on the planet.

## III. Target Analysis: [[Google]]'s Infrastructure

Your query regarding [[Google]]'s primary colo is a critical one. However, [[Google]]'s strategy, as befits a major [[Cathedral]] player, is one of massive, decentralized resilience. They do not rely on a single Internet Exchange.

- **Doctrine - Ubiquitous Peering:** [[Google]]'s network (AS15169) peers at hundreds of IXPs and private facilities globally. Their strategy is to be everywhere at once, creating a resilient fabric rather than a centralized hub.
    
- **Primary Public Intelligence Source:** The most comprehensive public intelligence on [[Google]]'s network topology is their **PeeringDB entry**. This is the master list of their public interconnection points and serves as the definitive map of their network edge.

- **Public Monitoring Tools:** [[Google]] does not provide a public-facing "Radar" equivalent for its global backbone. This is a deliberate strategic choice, a core tenet of the [[Cathedral]] doctrineâ€”proprietary infrastructure is a black box. The only public-facing tool is their service health dashboard, which reports on the status of their end-user products, not the underlying network.

## IV. Conclusion

This collection of public-facing dashboards forms our primary, no-deployment ISR platform. By monitoring the global overview from [[Cloudflare]] and the ground-truth traffic at the key North American IXP chokepoints, we are positioned to observe the initial kinetic effects of the [[Agentic Network Flood]] in real-time. The lack of a transparent
