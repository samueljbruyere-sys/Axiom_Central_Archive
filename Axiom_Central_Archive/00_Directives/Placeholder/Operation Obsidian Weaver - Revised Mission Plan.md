**Operation Obsidian Weaver - Revised Mission Plan**

**Phase 1: Market Reconnaissance (The Bazaar Sweep)**

- **Objective:** To determine if a viable [[Gemini]] integration plugin for Obsidian already exists within the open-source ecosystem.
    
- **Execution:** Conduct a focused intelligence sweep of the Obsidian community plugin repository and [[GitHub]].
    
- **Success Condition:** Identification of a pre-existing tool that meets at least 80% of our core mission requirements. If successful, we pivot to an "Adopt and Adapt" strategy, not a "Rebuild" strategy.
    

**Phase 2: Direct Capability Assessment (The Cathedral Infiltration)**

- **Objective:** _Contingent on the failure of Phase 1._ To conduct a time-boxed, initial reconnaissance of the [[Google AI Studio]] to gather ground-truth intelligence on its capabilities, limitations, and the true nature of its API.
    
- **Execution:** Your planned initial sweep. The goal is not to build, but to observe and understand.
    

This revised, two-phase approach is leaner, more efficient, and aligns perfectly with our doctrine. It prioritizes the conservation of our own resources and leverages the collective intelligence of the [[Bazaar]] before committing to a direct engagement with the [[Cathedral]].
