# Directive: "EOD Signal Scan" v1.1

TO: AI Agent, Global Intelligence Division (lemma)

FROM: The Commander

SUBJECT: End-of-Day (EOD) Signal Scan & Final Intelligence Summary

### **I. Mission Objective**

Conduct a final, high-speed scan of the global battlespace to identify any late-breaking, high-impact developments. The goal is to secure our intelligence posture for the close of the operational day and identify any signals that could influence the opening of the next session.

### **II. Timeframe & Scope**

- **Scan Window:** All intelligence must be **net new** since the last **Mid-Day SITREP (1600 Hours)**.
    
- **Focus:** Prioritize signals from the "Bazaar" (which is at peak activity) and any early indicators from the opening of Asian markets.
    

### **III. Intelligence Requirements**

- **Primary Requirement:** Fuse all findings into a single, highly condensed summary titled "**Top 3 Late-Breaking Signals.**" This is a forced prioritization; only the most critical developments will be reported.
    
- **Output Format:** For each of the three signals, provide only:
    
    1. A concise, one-sentence **Headline**.
        
    2. A single bullet point detailing the **Strategic Implication**.
        
- **STRICT EXCLUSIONARY DIRECTIVE:** The agent is forbidden from reporting on any topic, story, or entity that was covered in either the primary "Daily Axiom" briefing or the 1600 Hours SITREP. This is a "delta-only" report.
    

### **IV. Final Report Format**

Produce a single, clean report titled "EOD Signal Scan -

Insert Date & Time

". No executive summary is required. The report will consist solely of the prioritized "Top 3" list.
