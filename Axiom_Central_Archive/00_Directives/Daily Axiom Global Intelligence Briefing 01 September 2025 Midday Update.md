# Daily Axiom Global Intelligence Briefing – 01 September 2025

## Executive Summary

[[Meta]]’s Superintelligence Labs has initiated trial integrations of [[Google]]’s [[Gemini]] and [[OpenAI]]’s [[GPT-5]] across [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], and [[WhatsApp]] between 29 Aug and 1 Sept 2025. This move marks the industry’s first large-scale embrace of multi-vendor [[AI]] interoperability, shifting power away from single-stack incumbents and triggering fresh antitrust and safety narratives.
