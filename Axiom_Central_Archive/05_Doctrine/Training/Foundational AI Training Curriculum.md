# Foundational AI Training Curriculum

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a structured, zero-cost training curriculum for achieving foundational proficiency in modern [[AI]] and [[LLM]] operations. The curriculum is composed of publicly available, high-quality courses offered by key players in both the [[Cathedral]] and [[Bazaar]]. Mastery of these materials is a prerequisite for any operator seeking to build or deploy sovereign agentic assets.

## Phase 1: Foundational Concepts (The War College)

**Objective:** To establish a firm grasp of the core principles and technologies that define the battlespace.

- **Asset:** [[Google]] AI for Anyone (via [[Coursera]])
    
    - **Strategic Value:** Provides the high-level doctrinal overview from a primary [[Cathedral]] entity. Essential for understanding the enemy's public-facing language and strategic framing.
        
- **Asset:** [[Hugging Face]] NLP Course
    
    - **Strategic Value:** This is the primary field manual for the [[Bazaar]]. It provides the tactical, hands-on skills required to operate and fine-tune the open-source models that are the bedrock of our sovereign capabilities.
        

## Phase 2: Specialization (Advanced Infantry Training)

**Objective:** To achieve proficiency in the specialized sub-domains of [[AI]] operations.

- **Asset:** DeepLearning.AI - LangChain for LLM Application Development
    
    - **Strategic Value:** Provides mastery of the primary orchestration layer for building agentic systems. This is the science of chaining together different cognitive tools to achieve a complex mission objective.
        
- **Asset:** OpenAI - ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers
    
    - **Strategic Value:** Direct instruction from a key [[Cathedral]] weapons manufacturer on how to effectively command their cognitive assets. Understanding prompt engineering is the modern equivalent of marksmanship.
        
- **Asset:** Andrej Karpathy - Neural Networks: Zero to Hero
    
    - **Strategic Value:** A deep-dive into the fundamental mechanics of the weapon systems themselves. This is the "armorer's course," providing a first-principles understanding of how neural networks operate.
        

## Conclusion

Completion of this curriculum provides an operator with the full-spectrum knowledge required for modern [[AI]] operations,
