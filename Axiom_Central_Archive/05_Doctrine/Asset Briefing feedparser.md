# Asset Briefing: feedparser

## Primary Function: Specialized SIGINT Officer (RSS/Atom Feeds)

`feedparser` is a highly specialized Python library. Its sole mission is to intercept and parse structured intelligence feeds, specifically RSS and Atom feeds, which are the standard protocols used by news organizations and blogs to syndicate their content.

## Tactical Analysis

While [[Selenium]] is our all-domain scout, capable of navigating any web environment, `feedparser` is our signals intelligence specialist trained for a single, high-value task.

- **Efficiency:** It does not require a browser. It makes a simple, direct `HTTP Request` to the feed URL and receives clean, structured data in return. This makes it orders of magnitude faster and less resource-intensive than a full browser-based agent.
    
- **Reliability:** HTML structures on websites change constantly, breaking our CSS selectors. RSS/Atom feed structures are standardized and rarely change. An agent built on `feedparser` is far more robust and less brittle than one built on scraping.
    
- **Signal Purity:** It bypasses all the noise of a webpage—ads, navigation menus, JavaScript—and delivers only the core intelligence: headlines, summaries, publication dates, and links.
    

Operationally, `feedparser` is our preferred tool when the target provides a feed. We only deploy a heavy asset like [[Selenium]] when a feed is unavailable and we are forced to operate on a hardened, dynamic HTML-only target.
