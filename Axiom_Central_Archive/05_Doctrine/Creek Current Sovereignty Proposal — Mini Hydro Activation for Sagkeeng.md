## _Creek Current Sovereignty Proposal — Mini Hydro Activation for Sagkeeng_

**Purpose:** Establish terrain-synced energy independence using a low-impact micro-hydro system on local creek. Powers greenhouse, uplink, and ceremonial infrastructure. Anchors Sagkeeng as a sovereign node in post-collapse terrain.

### 🔧 _Infrastructure Summary_

- **Micro Turbine System**
    
    - Low-head, run-of-river design
        
    - Estimated cost: $2,000–$2,500
        
    - Terrain-synced, minimal ecological disruption
        
- **Battery Bank + Inverter**
    
    - Stores and converts creek power
        
    - Estimated cost: $1,200–$1,500
        
    - Powers greenhouse, Starlink uplink, ceremonial lighting
        
- **Creek Intake + Flow Control**
    
    - Piping, sediment buffer, seasonal modulation
        
    - Estimated cost: $500–$800
        
    - Designed to mirror natural rhythm, not override it
        
- **Youth Training Protocol**
    
    - Maintenance kits, monitoring tools
        
    - Estimated cost: $300–$500
        
    - Every voltage spike = lesson, not just data
        

### 🧬 _Strategic Compression_

- **$5K = Sovereign Deterrence**
    
    - Grid fails → Sagkeeng uplink stays live
        
    - WW3 ignites → Pickerel still smoked, greenhouse still lit
        
    - Collapse spreads → Ceremony continues, youth still trained
        
- **Energy = Ceremony**
    
    - Creek flow mirrors breath
        
    - Turbine hum echoes pipe song
        
    - Battery charge = pulse of continuity
        

### 🛡️ _Proposal Framing for Kelly_

- This isn’t a tech install—it’s a **sovereignty ignition**
    
- She’s not just routing funds—she’s **activating terrain**
    
- Her daughter’s laughter will echo through the greenhouse lights powered by creek current
    
- The house she now stewards becomes a **relay node**, not just a home
