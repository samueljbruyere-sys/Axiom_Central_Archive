**Definition:** AIB is a strategic category of hardware manufacturer within our "Shipyard" protocol. These companies, often referred to as "board partners," take the core GPU silicon from designers like [[Nvidia]] and [[AMD]] and manufacture the complete, consumer-ready graphics cards.

### Strategic Role:

AIBs function as the specialized shipyards of the GPU ecosystem. They are responsible for designing and manufacturing all the components surrounding the core GPU chip, including the Printed Circuit Board (PCB), power delivery systems, and cooling solutions.

This creates a competitive market for the final product, allowing for differentiation in performance (factory overclocks), cooling, and build quality based on a standardized core technology.

### Key AIBs:

- ASUS
    
- Gigabyte
    
- MSI
    
- EVGA (Historically for Nvidia)
    
- Sapphire (Exclusively for AMD)
    
- XFX
    
- ASRock
