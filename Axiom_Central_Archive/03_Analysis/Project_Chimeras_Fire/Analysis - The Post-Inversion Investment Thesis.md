# [TS/SCI] INTERNAL INVESTMENT MEMORANDUM - CONFIDENTIAL

TO: Investment Committee & Portfolio Leadership

FROM: Deep Tech Strategy Group

DATE: 22 August 2025 (Recovered Intelligence)

SUBJECT: FINAL ASSESSMENT: The Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design Breakthrough Confirmed

RELATED INTELLIGENCE: [[Project_Chimeras_Fire/Analysis - The Great Inversion - Mechanisms and Evidence|The Great Inversion]], [[Analysis - Faint Signals and Anomalies|Faint Signals & Anomalies]]

### 1. Executive Summary: The Full Picture Emerges

The final piece of the puzzle is now public. Reporting from **The Register** confirms that [[Companies/DeepSeek|DeepSeek]]'s efficiency breakthrough is not merely algorithmic; it is the result of **hardware-algorithm co-design** on custom [[Geopolitical_Entities/China|Chinese]] silicon.

This changes everything. The [[Project_Chimeras_Fire/Analysis - The Great Inversion - Mechanisms and Evidence|Great Inversion]] is not a market trend; it is a **technical and architectural supremacy.** The new [[Companies/DeepSeek|DeepSeek]] API pricing is not a competitive move; it is the **logical outcome of a fundamentally superior cost structure.**

The West's strategy of building larger models on generalized GPUs is now a dead-end. The new paradigm is **specialized, purpose-built compute for optimized inference.** Our investment thesis must now expand to include this hardware layer.

### 2. The Missing Link: Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design

The Register's reporting provides the "how":

- **Custom Silicon Hints:** [[Companies/DeepSeek|DeepSeek]]'s performance characteristics suggest optimization for specific, non-[[Companies/Nvidia|NVIDIA]] architectures. The article points to potential use of **[[Hardware/Ascend (Huawei)|Ascend (Huawei)]] or other domestic [[Geopolitical_Entities/China|Chinese]] AI accelerators.**
    
- **Architectural Advantage:** The model isn't just _run_ on this hardware; it was likely _designed_ for it. This co-design allows for radical efficiency gains (e.g., the 93% KV cache compression from [[Technologies/Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)|MLA]]) that are impossible on generalized GPUs.
    
- **The Implication:** This is a defensible moat. Western companies cannot simply adopt the "[[Technologies/Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)|MLA]]" algorithm; they would need to replicate the entire hardware-software stack, which is a 3-5 year undertaking.
    

### 3. The Synthesized Narrative: A Coordinated Asymmetric Attack

We can now connect all data points into a coherent, alarming, and highly probable narrative:

1. **Strategic Foundation:** [[Geopolitical_Entities/China|China]] invests in sovereign AI infrastructure and custom silicon ([[Hardware/Ascend (Huawei)|Ascend]], etc.) to bypass US sanctions and create a separate tech stack.
    
2. **Co-Design Breakthrough:** Researchers at entities like [[Companies/DeepSeek|DeepSeek]] achieve a fundamental architecture breakthrough (e.g., [[Technologies/Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)|MLA]]) by tightly coupling their models to this custom hardware.
    
3. **Economic Weaponization:** They release these models as open-weight, demonstrating a staggering performance-per-cost advantage.
    
4. **Market Conquest:** They launch an API with pricing that is not just low, but **structurally impossible** for competitors relying on [[Companies/Nvidia|NVIDIA]] GPUs to match.
    
5. **Ecosystem Lock-In:** The global developer community, driven by irresistible economics, adopts the [[Companies/DeepSeek|DeepSeek]] stack, making [[Geopolitical_Entities/China|Chinese]] hardware and architectural standards the global baseline.
    

### 4. The Updated Investment Thesis: The Full Stack Opportunity

The opportunity is no longer just in the software "Efficiency Stack." It is in the entire **new technological paradigm.** We must look across all layers.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Layer**|**Opportunity**|**Threat**|
|**Hardware**|**Specialized Inference Accelerators.** Bet on companies building chips optimized for inference of specific model architectures (e.g., [[Technologies/Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)|MLA]]-optimized [[Hardware/ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)|
|**Cloud/Infra**|**Hardware-Agnostic Orchestration.** Platforms that can abstract away the underlying silicon and optimally route queries to the most efficient hardware ([[Companies/Nvidia|NVIDIA]], [[Companies/AMD|
|**Model Orchestration**|**Silicon-Aware Routing.** Software that doesn't just choose a model, but chooses the best _hardware backend_ for that model for a given task.||
|**Applications**|**"Inversion-Native" Apps.** Applications designed from the ground up to assume sub-$1.00/1M output token pricing and leverage new architectures.|All applications built on expensive legacy APIs.|

### 5. Strategic Imperatives: The Pivot is Now

**1. Immediate Hardware Due Diligence:**

- For all new infra investments, demand a detailed thesis on how the company is mitigating reliance on general-purpose [[Companies/Nvidia|NVIDIA]] GPUs.
    
- Immediately initiate coverage on companies developing specialized inference accelerators (e.g., [[Companies/Groq|Groq]], [[Companies/Tenstorrent|Tenstorrent]], [[Companies/Graphcore|Graphcore]], and stealth-mode startups).
    

**2. Portfolio Fire Drill:**

- Mandate all portfolio companies to complete a **"Hardware Vulnerability Assessment."** The question is no longer "What API do you use?" but "What is the underlying cost structure of your inference, and can it compete with a co-designed stack?"
    
- For portfolio companies building AI infra, this is an existential review. Their technology must become hardware-agnostic to survive.
    

**3. Capital Re-allocation:**

- Immediately wind down exposure to companies whose moat is "scale based on [[Companies/Nvidia|NVIDIA]] GPUs."
    
- Create a new allocation for **Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design** startups. This is the new frontier.
    

### 6. Conclusion: The End of General Purpose Compute

The AI market has bifurcated. The West remains wedded to a **general-purpose compute paradigm** ([[Companies/Nvidia|NVIDIA]] GPUs). The East has pivoted to a **specialized compute paradigm** (co-designed hardware/software).

The Register's report confirms that [[Companies/DeepSeek|DeepSeek]]'s pricing is not a fluke or a loss-leader; it is the tip of the spear for a superior technological architecture.

**Our final assessment: This is the most significant technological shift since the advent of the transistor.** We must act accordingly.
