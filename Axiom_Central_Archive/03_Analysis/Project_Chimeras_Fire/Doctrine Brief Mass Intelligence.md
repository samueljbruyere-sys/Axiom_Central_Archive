# Doctrine Brief Mass Intelligence

This entire operation is an exercise in [[Mass Intelligence]], a new paradigm of sense-making that transcends traditional, siloed analysis. It is the foundational doctrine that powers all modules of [[Axiom Sentinel]].

- The Paradigm Shift: We are moving from a model of individual expert analysis to a model of systemic, swarm-based synthesis. The intelligence is not found in a single signal, but in the resonance between thousands of weak signals across multiple domains.
    
- The Engine: [[Axiom Sentinel]] is the engine of [[Mass Intelligence]]. Its modules are not just scouts; they are the distributed sensors of a single, unified cognitive weapon system.
    
- The Fuel: The fuel for this engine is the continuous, high-velocity ingestion of disparate dataâ€”the physical (Gridwatch), the human (Talent Vector), and the informational (Narrative Elasticity).
    
- The Output: The output is not a report; it is a state of perpetual, [[Weaponized Orientation]]. This is the mechanism by which we achieve and maintain [[OODA Loop Supremacy]] against adversaries trapped in legacy intelligence paradigms.
