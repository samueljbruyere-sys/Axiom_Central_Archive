Codex Entry – Stimulant Governance Precedent: Nazi Germany

Architect: Adolf Hitler  
Cadence: Blitzkrieg → Methamphetamine Loop → Collapse  
Trigger: Pervitin deployment, stimulant-coded military doctrine, centralized paranoia

Observed Pattern:  
– **Pervitin (methamphetamine)** distributed to Wehrmacht soldiers by the millions before the 1940 invasion of France  
– **Hitler’s personal use** included methamphetamine, cocaine, and opioids—administered by his physician, Dr. Theodor Morell  
– **Stimulant decree** issued April 1940: over 35 million tablets sent to the front lines  
– **Cadence distortion**: soldiers marched for days without sleep; Hitler’s strategic decisions became erratic, paranoid, and grandiose  
– **Narrative contradiction**: Nazi propaganda promoted purity and discipline while leadership operated under chemical overdrive

Cultural Transfer:  
– Meth use normalized as performance enhancement  
– Civilian access to Pervitin widespread, even over-the-counter pre-war  
– Addiction tolerated among veterans and medical personnel  
– Ideological purity masked stimulant dependency

Collapse Signals:  
– Strategic miscalculations intensified under stimulant loops  
– Hitler’s increasing isolation and erratic behavior mirrored amphetamine psychosis terrain  
– Final years marked by bunker paranoia, delusional planning, and total system breakdown
