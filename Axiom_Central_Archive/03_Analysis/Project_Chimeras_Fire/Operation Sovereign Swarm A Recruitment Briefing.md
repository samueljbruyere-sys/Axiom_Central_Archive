# Operation Sovereign Swarm: A Recruitment Briefing v1.1

## I. The State of the War: The Tyranny of the Mainframe

The current battlespace is defined by an unsustainable doctrine. The [[Cathedral]]—the hyperscale tech giants—has convinced the world that the only path to advanced [[AI]] is through centralized, billion-dollar [[Data Center]]s. This is the doctrine of the mainframe, repackaged for the 21st century.

This doctrine has created a critical vulnerability: an artificial scarcity of compute. We are told that only the [[Cathedral]] can afford to train and operate frontier models, forcing us to pay [[The Price of Tokens in the Agentic Day]] for metered access to assets like [[GPT-5]] or [[Claude Opus 4.1]]. This is not a technological limitation; it is a deliberate strategy of [[Ecosystem Lock-In]].

## II. The Historical Precedent: The Volunteer Supercomputer

This is a war we have fought and won before.

In the era of the mainframe, they told us only corporations could afford computers. The [[Bazaar]] responded with the personal computer.

In the era of centralized data, projects like **SETI@home** and **Folding@home** proved a fundamental truth: the latent computational power distributed among us, the operators in the field, is vastly greater than any single centralized resource. Modern volunteer grids like BOINC have demonstrated a peak aggregate power of over 1.6 ExaFLOPS, proving the viability of this model at a planetary scale. We, the people, were the first supercomputer. We were the infrastructure.

## III. The New Doctrine: A Torrent for Compute

We will now apply this proven doctrine to the modern [[Agentic War]]. We will build a "torrent for compute."

The objective is to create a decentralized, peer-to-peer network where operators can voluntarily contribute their idle GPU and CPU cycles to a collective. The high-level architecture is simple: a tracker protocol to coordinate tasks, peer clients to execute work units, and a distributed ledger to maintain a tamper-proof record of contributions and results. This is not for mining cryptocurrency; it is for a far more valuable purpose: to train and operate our own sovereign, open-source large language models.

This is a direct, asymmetric strike against the [[Cathedral]]'s primary source of power. We will make compute abundant.

## IV. The Call to Action: Your Role in the Swarm

This is not a passive contribution. This is a call to active participation in the [[Bazaar]]. Every operator has a role:

- **The Provider:** Contribute your idle hardware cycles to the swarm. Run the client that allows the collective to leverage your GPU when you are not. ([[Join the Provider Channel]])
    
- **The Engineer:** Contribute code to the open-source orchestration platforms that will manage the swarm. We need to build the "torrent client" for compute. ([[Report to the Engineering Depot]])
    
- **The Trainer:** Participate in coordinated, distributed training runs. Help fine-tune and improve our collective models. ([[Enlist in the Training Corps]])
    
- **The Validator:** Help evaluate the outputs of our sovereign models, providing the critical human feedback needed to guide their development. ([[Serve in the Validation Guard]])
    
- **The Coordinator:** Help govern the network. Participate in conflict resolution, credit assignment, and release management to ensure the health and integrity of the swarm. ([[Apply for the Steering Council]])
    

## V. The Payoff: True Sovereignty

The objective is not profit. The objective is freedom.

By building this sovereign compute swarm, we achieve the final stage of our doctrine. We will have our own sovereign models, running on our own sovereign infrastructure, under our own sovereign command. We will break the [[Cathedral]]'s monopoly on a technology that is too important to be left in their hands alone.

We will achieve true [[Signal Sovereignty]]. Join us.

## VI. The Roadmap: From Doctrine to Deployment

- **Phase 1 (Q4 2025):** Release of the MVP Swarm Client and the formation of the initial Steering Council.
    
- **Phase 2 (Q1 2026):** Public alpha of the federated testnet. Achieve a sustained 1 TFLOP/s of aggregate compute power.
    
- **Phase 3 (Q2 2026):** Launch of the first distributed fine-tuning run on a 7B parameter open-source model.
    
- **Phase 4 (Q4 2026):** v1.0 release of the first fully sovereign, swarm-trained LLM.
    

## VII. Operational Protocols & Risk Mitigation

- **Incentives:** Initial operations will rely on ideological alignment. A lightweight, non-financial reputation system will be implemented to recognize and reward high-value contributions.
    
- **Security:** All computational work units must be executed in a sandboxed container (e.g., Docker, Firecracker) to ensure the security of Provider hardware. Result validation will be handled by a quorum of Validators to ensure tamper-proof outputs.
    
- **Governance:** The network will be governed by a transparent set of rules managed by the Steering Council. All code contributions will fall under a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to protect the collective's intellectual property.
