### **NVIDIA-Focused Tools & Communities**

- **Source:** GitHub Repository
    
- **Asset:** `nvflashk` (Patched NVflash Utility)
    
- **URL:** `https://github.com/notfromstatefarm/nvflashk`
    
- **Strategic Note:** This is a community-patched version of [[Companies/Nvidia|Nvidia]]'s official tool, designed to bypass manufacturer restrictions on VBIOS flashing. It is a primary weapon for the "Bazaar" in this theater.

- **Asset:** VBIOS Viewer & Community Hub
    
- **URL:** `https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/rtx40x0-vbios-viewer-kepler-ada-nvidia-vbios-visualizer-opensource-pattern-for-imhex.322299/`
    
- **Strategic Note:** TechPowerUp serves as a central "Bazaar" for VBIOS files and the discussion of reverse-engineering and modification tools. This specific thread on a VBIOS visualizer is a key example of the open-source effort to deconstruct proprietary firmware.
    

### **AMD-Focused Tools**

- **Source:** GitHub Repository
    
- **Asset:** AtomBiosEditor
    
- **URL:** `https://github.com/Andybf/AtomBiosEditor`
    
- **Strategic Note:** An open-source firmware editor specifically for [[Companies/AMD|AMD]] Radeon graphics cards, allowing for direct modification of clock speeds, voltages, and power limits.
