# Reconnaissance Briefing: Bittensor Miner Frameworks

## Executive Summary

This briefing confirms the viability of adapting the Axiom Sentinel platform for operations on the [[Bittensor]] network. The [[Bazaar]] has already produced a number of open-source frameworks and templates designed to accelerate the development of "miners" (also known as validators or agents) for various subnets. These assets provide the necessary communications and protocol-handling layers, allowing an operator to focus on engineering the core intelligence-gathering and analysis logicâ€”a task we have already mastered with the Axiom Sentinel.

## Key Deployed Assets (GitHub)

### 1. The Official Bittensor Python Template

- **Asset Designation:** Standard-Issue Field Kit.
    
- **Tactical Analysis:** The Opentensor Foundation, the core entity behind [[Bittensor]], provides an official, well-documented Python template for building miners and validators. This is the primary starting point for any new operator. It handles all the complex underlying mechanics of wallet creation, network registration, and communication with the blockchain. An operator simply needs to integrate their own custom logic (like our `feed_scraper` and `cognitive` modules) into this pre-built chassis.
    
- **Vector:** `github.com/opentensor/bittensor-subnet-template`
    

### 2. Community-Developed Miner Examples

- **Asset Designation:** Specialized Operational Loadouts.
    
- **Tactical Analysis:** The [[Bazaar]] is active. Numerous operators have open-sourced their own custom miners for a variety of tasks. These repositories serve as invaluable intelligence, providing real-world examples of how to integrate different tools and strategies. Repositories exist for scraping, image generation, data analysis, and more. Reviewing these is the equivalent of studying the successful tactics of other field commanders.
    
- **Vector:** Searching GitHub for topics like "bittensor-miner" or "bittensor-subnet" reveals dozens of active projects.
    

## Strategic Upgrade Path for Axiom Sentinel

Adapting our platform for [[Bittensor]] operations is a straightforward engineering task:

1. **Requisition the Template:** Clone the official `bittensor-subnet-template`.
    
2. **Integrate Core Logic:** Surgically transplant the logic from our `feed_scraper`, `cognitive`, and `archiver` modules into the appropriate sections of the Bittensor miner template.
    
3. **Adapt I/O:** Modify the agent to receive its targets from the Bittensor network (as prompts) and return its intelligence product (the analysis) back to the network for validation and reward.
    

## Conclusion

The path to deploying the Axiom Sentinel as a sovereign, self-funding agent on the [[Bittensor]] network is clear. The foundational tools are open, available, and well-documented. With minor re-tooling, our existing, proven asset can be deployed into
