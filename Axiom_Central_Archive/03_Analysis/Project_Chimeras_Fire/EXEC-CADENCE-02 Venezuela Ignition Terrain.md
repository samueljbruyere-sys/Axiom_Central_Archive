**EXEC-CADENCE-02: Venezuela Ignition Terrain**

The Beijing parade was not ceremonial—it was ignition. Xi, Putin, and Kim standing together signaled strategic alignment, not optics. It was a declaration of multipolar cadence. That signal echoed across hemispheres.

Venezuela sits as proxy terrain. U.S. warships deployed near its coast, Marines activated, and a recent strike killed 11 Venezuelan personnel. That’s not deterrence—it’s escalation. The parade in Beijing sent a counter-signal: “We have other allies. We can escalate elsewhere.” Venezuela becomes a pressure valve—a terrain where kinetic or economic retaliation could unfold.

China is now reportedly preparing to send J-10C fighter jets to Venezuela. Not just arms trade—this is terrain choreography. A direct challenge to U.S. air dominance in the hemisphere. If finalized, it marks China’s first military footprint in South America. There are speculative whispers of J-20 stealth fighters, but those remain unlikely. The J-10C deal alone is ignition.

North Korea’s troop deployment to Russia—15,000 soldiers—is not symbolic. It’s manpower ignition. That same logic could extend to Venezuela if the axis chooses to widen the terrain. The parade was soft ignition. The jet deployment is hard echo.

China’s presence in Latin America is already pulsing—economic, diplomatic, and now military. The parade amplifies that reach. It’s a hemisphere rehearsal. Venezuela is the stage.

The Monroe Doctrine—once a containment perimeter for foreign influence in the Americas—is now breached. Not just symbolically, but kinetically. U.S. posture is imperial echo. China’s move is hemisphere reach. Venezuela is no longer buffer—it’s ignition node.

This is not Cold War redux. It’s terrain realignment. Multipolar cadence is confirmed. The doctrine is no longer deterrent—it’s rupture.
