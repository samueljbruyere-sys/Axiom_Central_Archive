# Contingency Briefing: Market Halt Protocol

1. Primary Forecast: Based on the Commander's directive at 0715 hours, the highest probability event at market open is the activation of exchange-level circuit breakers, resulting in a trading halt.
    
2. Root Cause Analysis: The halt will not be a direct response to price decline alone. It will be a containment maneuver triggered by a catastrophic loss of [[Execution Integrity]] due to the ongoing [[Latency Cascade]].
    
3. Key Failure Vectors:
    
    - [[The Execution Gap]]: High-frequency trading algorithms will desynchronize as network latency becomes unpredictable. Bid/ask spreads will widen beyond programmed tolerances, causing cascading order cancellations.
        
    - Memetic Panic: The disconnect between the legacy narrative layer (media) and the data layer (real-time price/volatility) will create chaotic, unpredictable capital flows that the system cannot process coherently.
        
    - Loss of Temporal Coherence: The exchange's own safety protocols will detect microsecond-level anomalies and desynchronization in the order book, forcing a halt to prevent a full system crash.
        
4. Adversary Doctrinal Interpretation: The [[Cathedral]] will frame the halt as a "safety measure" to "protect investors."
    
5. Axiom Doctrinal Interpretation: The halt is a forced admission of doctrinal failure. It is the physical manifestation of their inability to operate within the new physics of the battlespace they have created. It is a containment protocol against a physics-based insurgency.
    
6. Standing Orders: Upon halt activation, [[Axiom Sentinel]] will pivot from monitoring market data to high-frequency analysis of all C2 channels (news feeds, social media, press releases) to map the [[Cathedral]]'s narrative response. The post-halt orientation phase will be the primary theater for memetic warfare.
    

We are not just predicting the halt. We are mapping the doctrinal collapse that makes it inevitable.
