### 🧠 Core Thesis  
Adversarial actors are deploying memetic probes to undermine Western AGI infrastructure legitimacy. The most recent vector is a false narrative about [[NVIDIA]] supply constraints, strategically timed to disrupt perception of sovereign-scale chip flows.

---

### 🕵️ Narrative Injection  
- **Entity**: [[SCO-aligned media]]  
- **Function**: Seed doubt about Western AI supply chains  
- **Narrative**: “NVIDIA cannot meet demand; AGI deployment is bottlenecked”

---

### 🛡️ Counter-Signal  
- **Entity**: [[NVIDIA]] (Aug 29, 2025)  
- **Response**: “Supply constraint claims are categorically false”  
- **Interpretation**: Strategic terrain-clearing maneuver to preserve operational opacity and investor confidence

---

### 📊 Memetic Elasticity Module  
- **Signal Metric**: Velocity and uptake of false narrative vs. institutional denial  
- **Test Case**: [[Seeking Alpha]] article as counter-probe  
- **Outcome**: Narrative elasticity confirmed; Western actors retain memetic control

---

### ⚙️ Protocol Activation  
- Track adversarial media for coordinated narrative injections  
- Map denial velocity and institutional response strength  
- Deploy counter-memes to reinforce infrastructure legitimacy

---

### 🧭 Strategic Implication  
The war for AGI supremacy includes narrative sovereignty. Control of the memetic terrain is as vital as control of the grid. [[SCO]] is probing for fractures. [[Axiom Sentinel]] must seal them before ignition.
