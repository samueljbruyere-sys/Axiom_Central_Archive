# AI Democratization

**Definition:** AI Democratization is the strategic process by which advanced artificial intelligence capabilities are made accessible to a broad range of users, moving from the exclusive control of large, well-funded labs ("The Cathedral") to the hands of individual developers, researchers, and small organizations ("The Bazaar").

---
### Primary Drivers:

This trend is overwhelmingly driven by the **[[Bazaar]]** through several key mechanisms:

* **Open-Source Models:** The release of powerful, permissive models like `[[Llama]]` and `[[Qwen2.5-VL]]` that can be freely downloaded and modified.
* **Accessible Software Tools:** The development of user-friendly local inference tools like `[[Ollama]]` and `[[LM Studio]]` that lower the technical barrier to entry.
* **Community Collaboration:** The rapid, decentralized innovation that occurs on platforms like GitHub and Hugging Face.

### The Cathedral's Response:

The "Cathedral" engages with this trend strategically, not as a core philosophy. They participate through calculated open-source releases (e.g., `[[gpt-oss]]`) to generate goodwill, control the narrative, and cultivate talent, while maintaining their primary advantage through proprietary, state-of-the-art models.
